# About Me
* I am interested in using actuarial science, data science, machine learning, and programming to add value to a team whose moral values align with my own.
* I graduated in 2018 from Western Washington University with an M.S. in Mathematics. I studied advanced theoretical mathematics and did my thesis on sheaf cohomology.
