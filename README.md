# About Me
* I am interested in using data science, machine learning, programming, and actuarial science to add value to a team whose values align with my own while working on projects that I find engaging!
* I graduated in 2018 from Western Washington University with a Master of Science in Mathematics. I studied advanced theoretical mathematics and did my thesis on sheaf cohomology.
* I recently applied to the University of Washington Certificate in Data Science to stay current on statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Classes will be online in evenings allowing me to work and learn in tandem.
