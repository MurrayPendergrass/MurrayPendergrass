# About Me
* I am interested in using data science, machine learning, programming, and actuarial science to add value to a team whose values align with my own while working on projects that I find engaging!
* I graduated in 2018 from Western Washington University with an M.S. in Mathematics. I studied advanced theoretical mathematics and did my thesis on sheaf cohomology.
* I recently applied to the University of Washington data science certificate course to continue growing my statistical methods and ML techniques. Classes will be online in evenings starting April, 2025.
